-- Timestamp is a 64-bit signed integer representing an elapsed time since a
-- fixed epoch, stored in either of four units: seconds, milliseconds,
-- microseconds or nanoseconds, and is optionally annotated with a timezone.
--
-- Timestamp values do not include any leap seconds (in other words, all
-- days are considered 86400 seconds long).
--
-- Timestamps with a non-empty timezone
-- ------------------------------------
--
-- If a Timestamp column has a non-empty timezone value, its epoch is
-- 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (January 1st 1970, midnight) in the *UTC* timezone
-- (the Unix epoch), regardless of the Timestamp's own timezone.
--
-- Therefore, timestamp values with a non-empty timezone correspond to
-- physical points in time together with some additional information about
-- how the data was obtained and/or how to display it (the timezone).
--
--   For example, the timestamp value 0 with the timezone string "Europe/Paris"
--   corresponds to "January 1st 1970, 00h00" in the UTC timezone, but the
--   application may prefer to display it as "January 1st 1970, 01h00" in
--   the Europe/Paris timezone (which is the same physical point in time).
--
-- One consequence is that timestamp values with a non-empty timezone
-- can be compared and ordered directly, since they all share the same
-- well-known point of reference (the Unix epoch).
--
-- Timestamps with an unset / empty timezone
-- -----------------------------------------
--
-- If a Timestamp column has no timezone value, its epoch is
-- 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (January 1st 1970, midnight) in an *unknown* timezone.
--
-- Therefore, timestamp values without a timezone cannot be meaningfully
-- interpreted as physical points in time, but only as calendar / clock
-- indications ("wall clock time") in an unspecified timezone.
--
--   For example, the timestamp value 0 with an empty timezone string
--   corresponds to "January 1st 1970, 00h00" in an unknown timezone: there
--   is not enough information to interpret it as a well-defined physical
--   point in time.
--
-- One consequence is that timestamp values without a timezone cannot
-- be reliably compared or ordered, since they may have different points of
-- reference.  In particular, it is *not* possible to interpret an unset
-- or empty timezone as the same as "UTC".
--
-- Conversion between timezones
-- ----------------------------
--
-- If a Timestamp column has a non-empty timezone, changing the timezone
-- to a different non-empty value is a metadata-only operation:
-- the timestamp values need not change as their point of reference remains
-- the same (the Unix epoch).
--
-- However, if a Timestamp column has no timezone value, changing it to a
-- non-empty value requires to think about the desired semantics.
-- One possibility is to assume that the original timestamp values are
-- relative to the epoch of the timezone being set; timestamp values should
-- then adjusted to the Unix epoch (for example, changing the timezone from
-- empty to "Europe/Paris" would require converting the timestamp values
-- from "Europe/Paris" to "UTC", which seems counter-intuitive but is
-- nevertheless correct).
--
-- Guidelines for encoding data from external libraries
-- ----------------------------------------------------
--
-- Date & time libraries often have multiple different data types for temporal
-- data. In order to ease interoperability between different implementations the
-- Arrow project has some recommendations for encoding these types into a Timestamp
-- column.
--
-- An "instant" represents a physical point in time that has no relevant timezone
-- (for example, astronomical data). To encode an instant, use a Timestamp with
-- the timezone string set to "UTC", and make sure the Timestamp values
-- are relative to the UTC epoch (January 1st 1970, midnight).
--
-- A "zoned date-time" represents a physical point in time annotated with an
-- informative timezone (for example, the timezone in which the data was
-- recorded).  To encode a zoned date-time, use a Timestamp with the timezone
-- string set to the name of the timezone, and make sure the Timestamp values
-- are relative to the UTC epoch (January 1st 1970, midnight).
--
--  (There is some ambiguity between an instant and a zoned date-time with the
--   UTC timezone.  Both of these are stored the same in Arrow.  Typically,
--   this distinction does not matter.  If it does, then an application should
--   use custom metadata or an extension type to distinguish between the two cases.)
--
-- An "offset date-time" represents a physical point in time combined with an
-- explicit offset from UTC.  To encode an offset date-time, use a Timestamp
-- with the timezone string set to the numeric timezone offset string
-- (e.g. "+03:00"), and make sure the Timestamp values are relative to
-- the UTC epoch (January 1st 1970, midnight).
--
-- A "naive date-time" (also called "local date-time" in some libraries)
-- represents a wall clock time combined with a calendar date, but with
-- no indication of how to map this information to a physical point in time.
-- Naive date-times must be handled with care because of this missing
-- information, and also because daylight saving time (DST) may make
-- some values ambiguous or non-existent. A naive date-time may be
-- stored as a struct with Date and Time fields. However, it may also be
-- encoded into a Timestamp column with an empty timezone. The timestamp
-- values should be computed "as if" the timezone of the date-time values
-- was UTC; for example, the naive date-time "January 1st 1970, 00h00" would
-- be encoded as timestamp value 0.
